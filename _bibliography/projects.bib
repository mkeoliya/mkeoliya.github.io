  title={Translating C to Safe Rust},
  author={Keoliya, Mayank and Leebrant, Theodore},
  abstract={This project addresses the challenge of safe and efficient memory management in systems pro- gramming and presents an approach for automatically translating Rust data structures from RefCell to GhostCell. RefCell provides interior mutability and safe mutation of immutable data structures but incurs performance overhead due to runtime borrow checking. GhostCell avoids this overhead by using compile-time borrow checking but requires significant code changes. We propose a translation framework that preserves the original code’s semantics while taking advantage of GhostCell’s compile-time borrow checking.
To evaluate our approach, we conducted a benchmarking study comparing the perfor- mance of the translated code with the original and manually translated code. Our results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance improvements over RefCell. Our con- tribution is a practical solution for Rust programmers who wish to migrate their code from Re- fCell to GhostCell without the need for manual translation, enabling efficient and safe memory management in Rust code while maintaining ease of use and readability. This work opens up new avenues for research in automated migration of Rust code and provides valuable insights for programmers and language designers on the benefits and limitations of Rust’s memory management system.},

  title={Implementing MicroKanren in Haskell},
  author={Keoliya, Mayank and Leebrant, Theodore},
  abstract={This paper discusses the miniKanren family of languages, and in particular, the implementation of a desugared subset, microKanren, in the Haskell programming language. A comprehensive explanation of the implementation is undertaken, and possible explorations for quines, SAT solvers and procedural- logic programming are further elaborated.},
