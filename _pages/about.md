Hi! I'm Mayank, a first-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I work with [Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/) and [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/) on neurosymbolic AI in clinical and genomic settings. I'm currently looking for **opportunities to work on trustworthy AI for healthcare in summer 2024** -- hit me up if you're working on something similar!

<h2> past </h2>
Before [sailing to Philadelphia](https://open.spotify.com/track/5dFbGFPR2GkgIPvfnAo3R3?si=b8d8fe1447964f15), I read my bachelor's at the National University of Singapore, where I studied computer science and [a bunch of other things](https://usp.nus.edu.sg). I worked on research in [formal verification](https://ilyasergey.net/assets/pdf/papers/sisyphus-pldi23.pdf) and Rust with Prof. Ilya Sergey at the [VERSE Lab](https://verse-lab.github.io). I also spent a summer at [CVWO](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~vwo/) to build better systems for non-profits.

Before [slinging to Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_sling), I grew up in Calcutta, the most charming city in India. I'm a self-styled ambassador for the city, so if you're heading there for a short trip, do let me know!


<h2> fun </h2>
I've officially taken the plunge into learning Chinese in 2024 (谢谢王老师!). When I'm not diving into Mandarin tones, I'll be [talking about history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8KrLy48DMI), stalking old architecture in Philly, playing table tennis, spending hours on [Every Noise](https://everynoise.com), [reading](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSQZ2UlTvS6pKx0YPUPPMaStGogvCBvf5obVg-0s6dPIQrnNcQ6iFueym1s0NnVBJAV2dPb3Rx_laNN/pub), and daydreaming about [Singaporean food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PQB1S5sZQ0).
