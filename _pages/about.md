Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I work with [Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/) and [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/) on programming languages and neurosymbolic AI for healthcare. I'm currently looking for **opportunities to work on trustworthy AI for healthcare in summer 2024**.

Before [sailing to Philadelphia](https://open.spotify.com/track/5dFbGFPR2GkgIPvfnAo3R3?si=b8d8fe1447964f15), I did my undergrad at the National University of Singapore, where I studied computer science and [a bunch of other things](https://usp.nus.edu.sg).

I love wondering about **programming languages** (especially [ones](https://ocaml.org) [with](https://haskell.org) [Î»s](https://docs.sourceacademy.org/)), so I worked on PL research at the [VERSE Lab](https://verse-lab.github.io) on formal verification and compilers. 

I want to make PL and hacker culture more fun for beginners. At NUS, I helped out at [NUS Hackers](https://nushackers.org) to make that happen.

I enjoy [reading](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K40lfch5zsgPn7jrA9-B5mMZLGxFp-buyBgo1dvHRTA/edit?usp=sharing), [talking about history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8KrLy48DMI), going on hikes, playing racquet sports, [writing](https://github.com/mkeoliya/USP-Papers), and spending hours [discovering music](https://everynoise.com). I am also the world's biggest fan of Singaporean food.
